# PHONEBOOK
A Python phonebook program is a simple application that allows users to store and manage contact information. It typically provides basic functionality such as adding, deleting, updating, and searching for contacts. Users can input names, phone numbers, and other details, and the program stores this data in a data structure like a dictionary or a database. Users can then retrieve contact information by searching for a name or perform other operations like editing or deleting entries. This type of program is often used as a beginner's project to practice Python programming and learn about data handling and basic user interfaces.
